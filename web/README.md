# Miles Tracker application

This application allows you to effectively track the amount of miles that you have accumulated from your credit cards, and 
also allows you to track your trip goals.

This saves you time from doing the following:
1. Go to each bank's website to check the points-to-miles conversion rate 
2. Manually calculate the miles that you have accumulated from every credit card
3. Go to the SIA website to calculate how many miles are required for your intended trip.
